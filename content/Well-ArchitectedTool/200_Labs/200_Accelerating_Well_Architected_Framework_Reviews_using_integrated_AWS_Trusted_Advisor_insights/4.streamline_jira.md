By now, you should have completed the simulated AWS Well-Architected Framework review for your sample workload. This review provides you with insights and actionable items that you need to take towards improving your workload's architecture.

To ensure accountability towards these improvement action items, you need to incorporate them into your organizational process. One way to achieve this is to manage these items using a change management system.

In this section of the lab, we will walk you through a quick example of how you can take the insights and actionable items from the AWS Well-Architected Framework review and manage them in a popular change management system, JIRA. You will streamline the creation and management of these actionable improvement items in JIRA, using integrations made possible by AWS Well-Architected Tool APIs and AWS serverless services.
