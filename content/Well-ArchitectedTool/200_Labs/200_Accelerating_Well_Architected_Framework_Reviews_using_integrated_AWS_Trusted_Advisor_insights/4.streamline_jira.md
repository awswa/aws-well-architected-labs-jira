By now, you should have completed the simulated AWS Well-Architected Framework review for your sample workload. This review provides you with insights and actionable items that you need to take towards improving your workload's architecture.

To ensure accountability towards these improvement action items, you need to incorporate them into your organizational process. One way to achieve this is to manage these items using a change management system.

In this section of the lab, we will walk you through a quick example of how you can take the insights and actionable items from the AWS Well-Architected Framework review and manage them in a popular change management system, JIRA. You will streamline the creation and management of these actionable improvement items in JIRA, using integrations made possible by AWS Well-Architected Tool APIs and AWS serverless services.

**NOTE**

The steps and integration pattern in this lab section are intended to provide guidance and showcase what is possible towards activities that should be performed on improvement action items produced at the back of the AWS Well-Architected review. The code provided through this example implementation is not intended for production. Please contact ____@amazon.com for any question.

Follow these steps to proceed.


### 1.0 Prepare Cloud9 workspace.

In this step you will provision a [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) stack that builds a Cloud9 workspace. This Cloud9 workspace will be used to run the provisioning script for JIRA integration. 


1. Download the sample workload CloudFormation Template [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sssalim-aws/aws-well-architected-labs/L200_WAFR_Acceleration/static/watool/200_Accelerating_Well_Architected_Framework_Reviews_using_integrated_AWS_Trusted_Advisor_insights/Code/cloud9.yaml).

2. Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console.

3. Click on "StackSets" in the navigation pane and then click on "Create Stack".

4. Under Specify template, select **Upload a template file** and upload the file you downloaded in step 1. Then Click on **Next**.

5. Specify `walab-wata-cloud9-workspace` as the **StackSet Name**.

6. Leave all settings as default and click **Next**, **Next**, **Submit** 

7. Wait until deployment is complete, and your Stack status is **CREATE_COMPLETE**
