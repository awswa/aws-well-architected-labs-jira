## Introduction

Cloud Intelligence Dashboards (CID) helps you to visualize and understand AWS cost and usage data in your organization by exploring interactive dashboards. However, in order to maintain least privilege principle, customers who use CID at scale of organization often would like to provide their users access only to the data for linked accounts which they own. Using [Row Level Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/restrict-access-to-a-data-set-using-row-level-security.html) (RLS) enables you to restrict the data a user can see to just what they are allowed to. This also applicable for customers with Multiple Management (Payer) Accounts .

## Prerequisite

For this solution you must have the following:

* Access to your AWS Organizations and ability to tag resources
* An [AWS Cost and Usage Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html) (CUR) or if from the multiple payers these must be replicated into a bucket, more info [here](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/100_labs/100_1_aws_account_setup/3_cur/#option-2-replicate-the-cur-bucket-to-your-cost-optimization-account-consolidate-multi-payer-curs)
* A CID deployed over this CUR data, checkout the new single deployment method [here](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/cost-usage-report-dashboards/dashboards/deploy_dashboards/). 
* A list of users and what level of access they require. This can be member accounts, organizational units (OU) or payers. 


## Solution 
This solution will use tags from your AWS Organization resources to create a dataset that will be used for the Row Level Security.

## Step by Step Guide

### Part1: Roles

If you are deploying this in a linked account you will need a Role in you Management account to let you access your AWS Organizations Data. There are two options for this:

**Option1** If you already have the [Optimization Data Collector Lab](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_optimization_data_collection/1_grant_permissions/#12-role-for-management-account) deployed you can use the Management role in that. 

**Option2** Else, you can deploy using the below:

{{%expand "Deployed Management Role" %}}
1.  Log into your **Management account** then click [Launch CloudFormation Template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?&templateURL=https://aws-well-architected-labs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Cost/Labs/300_Optimization_Data_Collection/Management.yaml&stackName=OptimizationManagementDataRoleStack)

2. Call the Stack **OptimizationManagementDataRoleStack**

3. In the Parameters section set **CostAccountID** as the ID of Cloud Intelligence Dashboard

4. Scroll to the bottom and click **Next**

5. Tick the acknowledge boxes and click **Create stack**.

6. You can see the role that was collected by clicking on **Resources** and clicking on the hyperlink under **Physical ID**.

### Part2: Tag your AWS Organization Resources

You must tag the AWS Organization Resources with the emails of the Quicksight Users that you wish to allow access to see the resources cost data. The below will show you how to tag a resource and this can be repeated. We will be using **AWS Quicksight User Emails**, see more [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/managing-users.html)

1. Log into your **Management account** then click on the top right hand corner on your account and select **Organization**
![Images/rls_organization.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_organization.png?classes=lab_picture_small)
2. Ensure you are on the **AWS accounts** tab

![Images/rls_organization_accounts.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_organization_accounts.png?classes=lab_picture_small)
You can select different levels of access. Tag one of the following and the use will have access to all data of that resource and any child accounts below it.

* Tag an Account
* Tag an Organization Unit
* Tag the Root 

3. To tag the resource click its name an scroll down to the tag section and click **Manage tags**

![Images/rls_organization_accounts_tags.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_organization_accounts_tags.png?classes=lab_picture_small)

4. Add the Key **cudos_users** and the Value of any **emails** you wish to allow access. These are colon delimited. Once added click **Save changes**

![Images/rls_organization_accounts_cudostags.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_organization_accounts_cudostags.png?classes=lab_picture_small)

5. Repeat on all resources with relevant emails. 

## Part3: Deploy Lambda Function

Using AWS CloudFormation we will deploy the lambda function to collect these tags. 

1. Log into your account with your QuickSight Cloud Inteligence Dashboards also known as CID. Click [Launch CloudFormation template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?&templateURL=https://aws-well-architected-labs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Cost/Labs/row-level-security/cudos_rls.yaml&stackName=CIDRowLevelSecurity) 

![Images/rls_cfn.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_cfn.png?classes=lab_picture_small)

2. Click **Next**.

3. Fill in the Parameters as seen below.

* CodeBucket - aws-well-architected-labs-{REGION-NAME} e.g. aws-well-architected-labs-ireland

{{%expand "AllowedValues S3" %}}

## Part4: Test Lambda Function

Your lambda functions will run automatically on the schedule you chose at deployment and will be ready within an hour. However, if you would like to test your functions please see the steps below. 
Once you have deployed your modules you will be able to test your Lambda function to get your first set of data in Amazon S3. 

1. From CloudFormation Click **Resources** and find the Lambda Function and click the Physical ID

![Images/rls_cfn_resources.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_cfn_resources.png?classes=lab_picture_small)
2. To test your Lambda function open respective Lambda in AWS Console and click **Test**

3. Enter an **Event name** of **Test**, click **Create**:

![Images/Configure_Test.png](/Cost/300_Organization_Data_CUR_Connection/Images/Configure_Test.png)

4.	Click **Test**

5. The function will run, it will take a minute or two given the size of the Organizations files and processing required, then return success. Click **Details** and view the output. 

6. You can go to your bucket in S3 and there should be a file in the folder CUDOS_RLS. 
![Images/rls_s3_object.png](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/Images/rls/rls_s3_object.png?classes=lab_picture_small)

7. Download this [qs_s3_manifest.json](/Cost/200_Cloud_Intelligence/qs_s3_manifest.json) file and replace <bucket> with the bucket you can see your data in. 

## Part5: Create RLS
We will now create the RLS Dataset in Amazon QuickSight and attach it to your datasets for CID. Please ensure the bucket you have placed the RLS file into has access to Amazon QuickSight, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/troubleshoot-connect-S3.html)

1. Go to Amazon QuickSight and login
2. Go to Datasets and click **New dataset**
