## Overview

AWS Cost Categories in **AWS Cost Explorer** provide a flexible way to categorize and analyze your AWS costs. With Cost Categories, you can group your AWS costs into categories that make sense for your organization, such as by department, team, or AWS service. Creating a report with visualization using AWS Cost Categories enables you to gain better visibility into your costs, forecast costs for the next 12 months, and make informed decisions about your AWS usage.

For more information about controlling access for AWS Cost Explorer, see [AWS Cost Management policy.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/billing-example-policies.html)
